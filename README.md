# Crime-Map-Plot-Analyzing-the-Safety
Visualizes crime data from the Los Angeles using Python and Folium. It creates a heatmap for overall crime density and a marker map for specific crime types and plot the location as burglary. The code efficiently handles large datasets and produces responsive  files to visualize, providing a valuable tool for  observe area safety.

Burglary Map

A burglary map is a specialized map that only displays crime incidents related to burglary(breaking into homes, shops, or property).
The data is filtered to show only burglary cases from the dataset.
Each burglary is shown with a marker/pin on the map.IT allows police, researchers, or the public to track burglary-prone areas and improve security measures.
